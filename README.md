# C++ Modules at 42 School üéì

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice to 42 Students
This repository serves as a learning reference. Please adhere to 42's academic integrity policy:
- Understand the code before using it as reference
- Don't copy solutions without comprehension
- Use this to learn concepts, not to bypass the learning process
